### 3.1.3

_Released 2017 Sep 22_

This build includes the following changes:

#### Bindings

- Added [rpmalloc](https://github.com/rampantpixels/rpmalloc) bindings.
    * Use `-Dorg.lwjgl.system.allocator=rpmalloc` to make it the default memory allocator.
- Added new extensions to OpenCL, EGL, OpenGL and OpenGL ES.
- Assimp: Updated to 4.0.1 (up from 3.3.1)
- bgfx: Updated to API version 48 (up from 41)
- EGL: Added support for latest extensions
- glfw: Updated to pre-release 3.3.0 version (up from 3.3.0 pre-release):
    * Improvements to error code query (`glfwGetError`)
    * More library initialization hints (`glfwInitHintString`)
    * SDL_GameControllerDB support
        * Import gamepad mappings (`glfwUpdateGamepadMappings`)
        * Query to determine whether a joystick has a gamepad mapping (`glfwJoystickIsGamepad`)
        * Query the name of a controller provided by its gamepad mapping (`glfwGetGamepadName`)
        * Retrieve gamepad input state (`glfwGetGamepadState`, `GLFW_GAMEPAD_*`, `GLFWgamepadstate`)
        * Query the SDL compatible GUID of a joystick (`glfwGetJoystickGUID`)
    * Linux: Moved to [evdev](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/libevdev/doc/latest/) for joystick input
    * EGL: Fixed support for `EGL_KHR_create_context_no_error`
    * GLX: Added support for `GLX_ARB_create_context_no_error`
    * WGL: Added support for `WGL_ARB_create_context_no_error` and `WGL_EXT_colorspace`

- Nuklear: Updated to 2.00.2 (up from 1.37.0)
- OpenAL: Added `ALC_SOFT_output_limiter` extension.
- OpenAL Soft: Updated to 1.18.2 (up from 1.17.2)

    * Updated `stb_dxt` to 1.07 (up from 1.06)
    * Updated `stb_image` to 2.16 (up from 2.15)
    * Updated `stb_image_resize` to 0.95 (up from 0.94)
    * Updated `stb_image_write` to 1.07 (up from 1.05)
    * Updated `stb_truetype` to 1.17 (up from 1.15)

- xxhash: Updated to 0.6.3 (up from 0.6.2)
- Yoga: Updated to 1.6.0 (up from 1.5.0)

#### Improvements

- Generator: Added `@NativeType` annotations to generated bindings. Documents the native type of:
    * Callback and struct classes.
    * Struct members.
    * Function parameters and return values.
- The default memory allocator on Windows is now the system allocator instead of jemalloc.
    * jemalloc is not properly optimized for Windows and its performance is not competitive.
    * jemalloc is still a major performance win on Linux and macOS.
    * rpmalloc is faster on all platforms but requires per-thread setup, so must be enabled manually.
- Buffers created via `MemoryUtil` may now have up to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` elements, regardless of element size.
    * For example this allows a `LongBuffer` allocation of up to 16GB.
- Added typed overloads to `MemoryUtil::memSet` and `MemoryUtil::memCopy`.
- `StructBuffer` subclasses are now `Iterable` and have `stream()` and `parallelStream()` methods.
- OpenGL: Added `LongBuffer` overloads to buffer object functions.

#### Fixes

- bgfx: Fixed signature of `bgfx_create_frame_buffer_from_attachment`.
- OpenGL: Fixed signature of `glPixelStoref`.
- OpenGL: `ARB_direct_state_access` interactions are now respected when checking if the extension is available.
- stb_image: added `ShortBuffer` overload to `stbi_image_free`.
- stb_truetype: Fixed signature of `stbtt_PackFontRangesGatherRects` and `stbtt_PackFontRangesRenderIntoRects`.

#### Breaking Changes

- glfw: Signature of `glfwGetError` has changed.
- jemalloc: Removed `JEmacros` and moved its functionality to `JEmalloc`.
- jemalloc: `ChunkHooks` has been replaced by `ExtentHooks`.
- OpenCL: Removed two confusing `clCompileProgram` overloads.
