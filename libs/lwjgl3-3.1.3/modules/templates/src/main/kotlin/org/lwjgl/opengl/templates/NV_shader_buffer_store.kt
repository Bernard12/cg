        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        This extension builds upon the mechanisms added by the NV_shader_buffer_load extension to allow shaders to perform random-access
        reads to buffer object memory without using dedicated buffer object binding points.  Instead, it allowed an application to make a buffer
        object resident, query a GPU address (pointer) for the buffer object, and then use that address as a pointer in shader code.  This approach allows
        shaders to access a large number of buffer objects without needing to repeatedly bind buffers to a limited number of fixed-functionality binding
        points.

        Requires ${GL30.core}, GLSL 1.30, ${NV_shader_buffer_load.link}, ${registryLinkTo("NV", "gpu_program5")} and/or ${registryLinkTo("NV", "gpu_shader5")}.
