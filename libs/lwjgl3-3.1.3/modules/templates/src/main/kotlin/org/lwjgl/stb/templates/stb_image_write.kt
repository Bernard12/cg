        <h3>ABOUT</h3>

        This header file is a library for writing images to C stdio.

        The PNG output is not optimal; it is 20-50% larger than the file written by a decent optimizing implementation. This library is designed for source
        code compactness and simplicitly, not optimal image file size or run-time performance.

        <h3>USAGE</h3>

        There are four functions, one for each image file format:
        ${codeBlock("""
int stbi_write_png(char const *filename, int w, int h, int comp, const void *data, int stride_in_bytes);
int stbi_write_bmp(char const *filename, int w, int h, int comp, const void *data);
int stbi_write_tga(char const *filename, int w, int h, int comp, const void *data);
int stbi_write_hdr(char const *filename, int w, int h, int comp, const void *data);""")}
        There are also four equivalent functions that use an arbitrary write function. You are expected to open/close your file-equivalent before and after
        calling these:
        ${codeBlock("""
int stbi_write_png_to_func(stbi_write_func *func, void *context, int w, int h, int comp, const void  *data, int stride_in_bytes);
int stbi_write_bmp_to_func(stbi_write_func *func, void *context, int w, int h, int comp, const void  *data);
int stbi_write_tga_to_func(stbi_write_func *func, void *context, int w, int h, int comp, const void  *data);
int stbi_write_hdr_to_func(stbi_write_func *func, void *context, int w, int h, int comp, const float *data);""")}
        where the callback is:
        ${codeBlock("""
void stbi_write_func(void *context, void *data, int size);""")}
        The functions create an image file defined by the parameters. The image is a rectangle of pixels stored from left-to-right, top-to-bottom. Each pixel
        contains {@code comp} channels of data stored interleaved with 8-bits per channel, in the following order: 1=Y, 2=YA, 3=RGB, 4=RGBA. (Y is monochrome
        color.) The rectangle is {@code w} pixels wide and {@code h} pixels tall. The {@code *data} pointer points to the first byte of the top-left-most
        pixel.

        PNG creates output files with the same number of components as the input.

        PNG supports writing rectangles of data even when the bytes storing rows of data are not consecutive in memory (e.g. sub-rectangles of a larger image),
        by supplying the stride between the beginning of adjacent rows. The other formats do not. (Thus you cannot write a native-format BMP through the BMP
        writer, both because it is in BGR order and because it may have padding at the end of the line.)
